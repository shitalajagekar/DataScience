Siva M,02-Jun-19,Verified Purchase,4 people found this helpful,"After using it for little more than a month, the back cover came out and hung from tiny ribbon connector attached to the watch and the watch stopped working. The UI responsiveness became laggy over time. While the watch provides several fitness related functions and the build quality is acceptable, it is disappointing to see the watch from a prestigious brand die in a very short time after spending a huge money on it. Few days before the watch became fully nonfunctional the charging dock started giving problem. To make it charge properly I had to press the dock and watch bottom together firmly or keep a heavy book or something alike on the watch kept on a table. At times even this setup won’t work making you rely on your luck. At the end it’s not worth the trouble going through. After several research, I found that all these problems I faced are very common in this model and realized I shouldn’t have bought it at all. The service support wasn’t that helpful though. Now the watch is happily sitting as a paperweight on my desk.

D'Serius Buyer,17-Feb-19,Verified Purchase,5 people found this helpful,"Returning it. I have used this devise for a whole month now and I have faced time and again issues with the touch interface not being responsive to inputs at all on multiple occasions. I want something that can work reliably every time. The watch looks amazing and had decent battery backup for a smart watch but this is too big a bug for me to own it. Software from wear os has a long way to go for fossil smart watches.

Mihir,18-Mar-19,Verified Purchase,One person found this helpful,"I have used other fitness trackers and smartwatches before and by far this has been the the easiest to use. I mainly bought this smart watch with the motive of it acting as my fitness tracker along with providing me with all the goodness of a smartwatch. And turns out, it fits the requirement just right!It allows me to not only set personal goals in terms of move minutes, heart points, step count etc via google fit but also keep a check on if I am meeting my goals or not. I can log my workouts in, the calories and try out breathing exercises in order to accomplish my fitness goals. It also allows me to keep a track on my water intake, my sleep and even wake me up by vibrating on my wrist with the inbuilt alarm option. If you're someone who's looking to make a change in your everyday lifestyle without losing on the style quotient - this smartwatch will be your best companion.

Somesh Miglani,28-Feb-19,Verified Purchase,,"The Fossil Q Gen 4 is the best & a beast among the smart & fitness sport watches available right now.It has a good built quality & a fantastic design. The watch is very durable, has a good battery life. The watch also seems to be heavy watch on paper, but on the daily use it does not feel heavy. The available dials are so cool & best looking. As far as the fitness side is concerned, it's an awesome device to monitor steps, running and heart rate.I HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU TO BUY THIS WATCH If YOU REALLY NEED A SMART & A FITNESS SPORTS GEAR.

Vikram Kirtikar,19-Jun-19,Verified Purchase,7 people found this helpful,"From the house of Fossil which makes designer watches, their newest baby comes in the form of the Fossil sport smartwatch. A light weight, smart looking, smartwatch which comes with a ton of features in it. Battery last for one and a half day easily. This can be achieved by keeping the always on display feature as it utilizes the advantage of an OLED display that only lights up what is required and not the entire screen when in standby mode. Another way to increase battery life is to be selective about the apps that we receive notifications from. We do not need notifications from all apps. Charging is easy and fast and fast means fast, that is within 1 hour to full charge with wireles charging. You just have to keep it on the charger provided. The heart rate monitor works great checking the heart rate at regular time intervals.The best part is the media control. Although you can download specific apps the inbuilt media control app is convenient. Play a song on your phone and the media app on the watch detects it instantaneously and then we don't touch our phone. Messages from different apps can be replied to via the watch itself. It detects voice well for Google assistant as well as speech to text. The watch is 5atm so no problem if rain or sweat. The sport part of the watch is pretty evident in its weight and the Google fit app doesn't disappoint. Let me be honest that I am not into much workout but the watch helps keep a track of my daily activity in terms of steps and the Google fit point system does motivate to achieve more. The difference is noticeable as I prefer walking more now to then see my watch appreciate my efforts. I commute daily in crowded trains. This watch is convenient and functional and does not require much effort in use. Wear Os is not the most perfect software yet and the one star less in the rating is for that, but the small glitches barely interfere with the usage of this watch. I have used the Sony smartwatch 2 prior to this and the evolution of smartwatches is very much evident when I use this Fossil smartwatch.To conclude the Fossil sport smartwatch is a watch for someone who is looking at getting a functional timepiece & more but does not want to compromise on looks, the feel and the design. With a very smart profile functionally and with looks, the Fossil sport smartwatch is the one to keep and keep on using. At the price point its a steal.

Justin siby,16-Jun-19,Verified Purchase,8 people found this helpful,"I’m using this Watch with an iPhone.The watch works fine with an iPhone but some of the features that we get when we connect to an android phone is missing. Watch will receive notification from iPhone but cannot reply back to a message from the watch itself. Google maps can be installed on the watch but to use it you will need an android device. My watch easily last for at-least 30+ hours for me with an above average usage. The watch is very light and have a good build quality. If you are using this watch with an android device you can unlock a lot more features. But for me with my iPhone the watch has every I need. It will notify me, helps to find my phone, fitness tracking,..

So, may be this is because of it, the black dial & the watch hands are difficult to read at very first glance. I have used few chronographs before but this is functionally not the best. I would any day prefer to exchange this for a CASIO Edifice. this is my first fossil. again not disappointed just not excited about it.

Amazon Customer,23-Sep-17,Verified Purchase,43 people found this helpful,"Watch gets delayed by 5 minutes every one week from day one.  Amazon didn't agree to replace watch. Only option left was to get it repaired but Fossil has just 2 outlets in Hyderabad so I needed to plan a day to visit Fossil outlet. Amazon & Fossil played ping pong between them, initially Fossil said, Amazon need to replace it & Amazon said, Fossil will need to repair it. It required atleast 5 calls to Amazon & 3 calls to Fossil to determine whose responsibility it is. I needed to visit Fossil outlet twice, finally they accepted the watch for repair which will take 30 days. I am still hoping Fossil will accept request for replacement. Be careful before buying Fossil products in India.

Tachymeter is a very useful device apart from being a design. For those who don't know check on the internet
